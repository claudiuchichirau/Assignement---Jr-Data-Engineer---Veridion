# Overview of Approach
## In this assignment, I aimed to combine three datasets containing information about companies from different sources: Facebook, Google, and a company website dataset. The goal was to merge these datasets to create a unified view while resolving potential conflicts and redundancies.

### What column will you use to join?

I chose to use the name column to perform the join operation because it serves as a common identifier across the three datasets. This allows us to align entries that refer to the same company, facilitating accurate comparisons and merging of their attributes.

### If you have data conflicts once you join, which one do you believe?

In case of data conflicts, I would prioritize the information from the Facebook dataset, as it often contains the most detailed and updated entries regarding a company's online presence. The logic is that Facebook profiles typically provide current contact information and active categories, which are essential for understanding the companyâ€™s operations.
